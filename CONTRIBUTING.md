# How to contribute

I am glad that you want to contribute to this project. Before making any changes, I suggest you coordinate it with the rest of developers by opening an issue. You can create a Pull Request with your contributions and once all major observations have been addressed, it can be merged into the repo.

All contributors should follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CRamsan/minesweepers/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
